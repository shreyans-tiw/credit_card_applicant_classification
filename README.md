# credit_card_applicant_classification

In this project, we intend to study relationships between the factors that influence the credit card approval rate for applicants, like occupation type and income level. The objective of our project is to build a classifier with the highest accuracy to figure out whether an applicant is likely to get their credit card approved or not. Finally, we are using various machine learning models such as K-nearest neighbors and Random Forest to figure out which classifies our data with the highest accuracy score.
